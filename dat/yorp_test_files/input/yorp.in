! Input parameters for the spin-axis dynamics due to YORP effect. The meaning
! of the parameters is the following
! 
!     yorp_flag : include the spin-axis evolution due to YORP effect. Note that
!                 this works only if the mfo_usef routine is required, i.e. only
!                 if also the Yarkovsky effect is added to the model
!                     1 => include YORP
!                .ne. 1 => not include YORP
!
!stoc_yorp_flag : include stochastic YORP effect.
!                     1 =>     include stochastic YORP
!                .ne. 1 => not include stochastic YORP
!  
!     step_auto : flag to choose an autmatic (constant) timestep for the spin-axis
!                 integration. 
!                     0 => timestep is specified by the user
!                .ne. 0 => timestep is selected automatically. In this case,
!                          each asteroid is assigned a timestep depending on 
!                          the diameter, and then the minimum is adopted. 
!                 NOTE: maximum timestep can be 50 years, and the minimum 1 year
!
!     step_user : timestep for the spin axis integration in years, defined by the user. 
!                 Maximum timestep allowed is 50 years, while minimum timestep is 1 year.
!
!       dt_out  : timestep for printing output on a file. 
!                 NOTE: if this is not a multiple of the timestep, a linear interpolation
!                 between two successive integration points is used
