Yarkovsky drift in mercury is implemented in mfo_user. The variables with the number of
bodies are
   nbod: total number of bodies
   nbig: total number of massive bodies, including the Sun
Note therefore that the massless bodies have indices
   nbig+1,...,nbod

The variable with the mass parameters is
   m(j) = GM(j)
and the units are AU, y and solar masses

For the values of the Yarkovsky drifts in input, I added a global variable called 
   dadt_My(NMAX)
The routine that reads every input file is
   mio_in
and it takes as arguments all the parameters needed to read.

id(NMAX)

id(nbod) = string( lim(1,1):min(24+lim(1,1),lim(2,1)) )

opt(8) contains the flag for the user defined force
